\section{Acknowledgments}
We would like to express a special thanks to our supervisor Joseph Kiniry, for sharing our interest in programming languages, thus making this project possible. Furthermore we would like to thank Emmanuel Stapf for not only allowing us access to the EiffelStudio repository, but also for helping us through our journey of learning Eiffel and the EiffelStudio structure. For her excellent modeling library, EiffelBase2, which is used for the type cheker, we would like to thank Nadia Polikarpova. For his work on the \bon{c}, especially the outline for the standard \bon{} types used in the type checker. Eric Bezault is gratefully acknowledged for his work on the \textsc{gobo} tools. We would also like to thank S\o ren Engel for many interesting discussions about the Eiffel programming language and EiffelStudio, in our joined voyage getting familiar with these two. Finally, we would like to thanks Christian Harrington and Nicolai Dahl for reviewing and proof reading of this report.
