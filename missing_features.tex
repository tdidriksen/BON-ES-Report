\section{Further development}
\subsection{BON Extractor}
If the \bon{ } extractor was to be developed further either by this project group or by another, there are a number of interesting features that could be added. 

Currently in the \bon{ } extraction no types are treated differently. Every type is just mirrored into the \bon{ } without further analysis. An interesting addition could be to analyze the inheritance of classes to see if they were of a certain kind. In example, if a class has a conforming inheritance from the \textsc{set} class, it is known that the class have the attributes of a set. The extractor could now transform the type in question into a predefined standard type, with the same attributes as a set. This, however, should not be enforced on the user. It is something the user should be able to turn off, in the case that he did not intend to use the class as a set.

In extension of this if the extractor was able to recognize certain standard types it would also be able to take use of the quantifications available in the textual \bon{ } language. When a feature call such as \textit{for\_all} is used the extractor could translate this into textual \bon{ } using the \textbf{for\_all} keyword. In example the quantification in figure \ref{fig:agent-for-all} could be translated into the textual \bon{ } in figure \ref{fig:bon-for-all}.

}

\end{figure}
This could cause issues when agents are more advanced that in this example. In an assertion it is not everything from the agent that will be interesting to analyze, and as such not everything should be included. The extractor could analyze what the \textbf{Result} keyword relies on and interpret that. This could easily lead to even more currently unknown complications, which is why this feature is not included in this project.

Another interesting feature to be added could be the ability to switch to textual \bon{ } view when showing a cluster. In EiffelStudio the user can select a cluster and see meta information about it. From this an option to change to both formal and informal textual \bon{ } view should be available. This could extract the textual \bon{ } from the classes contained in the cluster. This would add to the extended overview of the code base that the \bon{ } view already gives.

There are no way of expressing void safety directly in \bon, only through invariants. Therefore the attached keyword does not translate to textual \bon{ } in this implementation. A possible extension could be to let the project settings from Eiffel be expressed in the textual \bon{ } by generating invariants for attached features if the project setting is set to void safe. A attached feature \textit{f} could then translate into formal and informal \bon{ } like this:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
          Invariant              Constraint
               f /= Void               "Current must have an f"
\end{verbatim}

\normalsize Last but not least, the textual \bon{ } tool could be more interactive. The user could be able to add other classes from a project to a \bon{ } view. Furthermore, similar to the diagram tool already in place in EiffelStudio the \bon{ } tool could also work as a \textsc{case} tool (Computer Aided Software Engineering). The user could add classes through the \bon{ } view and they would be added into the cluster that was currently being viewed.

\paragraph{}
Related to the \bon{ } extractor it is obvious to also consider a tool working the opposite way. Generating Eiffel from textual \bon{ } would allow the user to specify a full system in textual \bon{ } with all features and contracts, generate the related Eiffel and he would have a full skeleton of the system ready to go. It would make specification and development go hand in hand.

\subsection{Bugs and missing features}
\subsubsection{BON Extractor}
The \bon{ } tool has a few flaws. The most notable one has to do with feature calls. At the time of writing feature calls are not translated properly into textual \bon{ } from Eiffel. Only the first feature upon which the call is done is extracted, not any following features, not arguments. The missing information is put in a comment if the contract has no tag. Considering a call x on feature y with a parameter z it would translate as such:
\begin{center}
\textit{y.x(z)} $\rightarrow$ \textit{y.} -\-- \textit{y.x(z)}
\end{center}

Furthermore, generics of a classes don't keep their formal name throughout the class. In a class \textsc{tuple [g][h]} the two will be represented by a G followed by an index. In the example of the tuple the G will be represented as G\#1 and the H as G\#2. This is still consistent and readable, but is not ideal as it can be confusing with many generics and more importantly, it does not type check.

When analyzing inheritance the consistency of comments seem to fail. The further down into the inheritance the tool digs, the more the comments seem to vanish. When classes To accommodate for this features without comments are called by their feature name in informal \bon. When changing the point of origin the comment structure seems to change.

All of these bugs most likely ground in a lack of understanding the abstract Eiffel syntax, which could be solved by studying this further.

Lastly, anchored types are translated directly into textual \bon. This is not a bug per se, but rather a suggestion that the \bon{ } language could support this. Anchored types is not supported by the type checker either, so it would require an expansion of it to do so.
