\section{EiffelStudio}
EiffelStudio is a full-featured, commercial grade IDE for the Eiffel Programming Language (\cite[Quote from Origo website]{eiffel2006}). It has many tools to ease designing systems with Eiffel and is focused on providing an "all-in-one" package for the user, such that no outside software is needed.

\subsection{The system}
EiffelStudio is consists of three main sections; libraries, framework, application (as seen in figure \ref{fig:eiffelstudio_structure}). This project mainly focuses on the \textsc{ui} subsection of Application, more specifically, the Tools part.

\paragraph{}
The \textsc{ui} consists of bars, tools and a window. The window shows the user the currently viewed context in the desired fashion, which can be i.e. the pure source code or a specific perspective on the source code, but also a visual representation. The bars and tools allows the user to switch what is currently being showed in the window without altering the source. When a user wants to change this, he will select the appropriate perspective and the window will be informed by this by the bar or tool in being utilized. When showing text, the window uses different formatters to translate the underlying source to the desired perspective on the code. The specific formatters does this by having a specialized output strategy define the text shown in the window based on an abstract Eiffel syntax. Figure \ref{fig:eiffelstudio_view_change} shows an overview of this. This is a description of how this works conceptually, and therefore might differ slightly from the actual implementation. A more precise description can be found in section \ref{implementation_eiffelstudio}

\subsubsection{Why in a view?}
\label{why_a_view}
EiffelStudio has multiple ways of showing the same code, which is taken care of by the View feature. While viewing a piece of Eiffel source code, you can switch to the interface view, for instance, where you can see the signature, comments and contracts of all the features  of the current class, including inherited ones. This gives the user the ability to overview over the structure of the class, through showing information not normally available, and hiding information that is not relevant to the view. In the case of the interface view, the body of features is hidden to ensure a proper overview and to remove clutter from viewing too many features at once.
\paragraph{}
The function of the textual \textsc{bon} tool is similar to this in many ways. It allows the user to see the code from a textual \textsc{bon} perspective, with the idea of charts (informal) and components (formal) to help giving an overview over the structure of the code. The exact functionality of the \textsc{bon} tool will be discussed in later sections. Due to the similarity between the currently implemented views and the textual \textsc{bon} tool, having this new tool as an added view makes it feel like an integrated part of EiffelStudio, and not some external tool.
