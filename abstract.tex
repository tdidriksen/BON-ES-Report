\begin{abstract}
In the world of object-oriented programming there are tools to analyze and design a system. One of these is the Business Object Notation (BON). The key concepts of BON are seamlessness, reversibility, and software contracting. Software contracting is an idea that is also fundamental in the Eiffel language, and as such the two goes well together.
 
EiffelStudio is the main IDE of Eiffel. It has many tools to ease the development of Eiffel systems, one of which is the view feature. With this you are able to view the code from different perspectives, such as contract view that will show you the code from a contract point of view, or the interface view that allows you to inspect the inherited features of a class.
 
There is, however, no way of linking Eiffel code to textual BON in EiffelStudio. We want to bridge this gap between these two closely related worlds. This report analyzes how to do this through adding an extra view to the already existing views that allows the user to see his Eiffel code from a textual BON perspective, (and also generate Eiffel code from textual BON). To ensure the quality of the extracted (or hand-written) textual BON, we discuss the implementation of a type checker.
